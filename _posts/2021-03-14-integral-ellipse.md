This is a classic problem: calculating the area of an ellipse given its major axis length $a \in \mathbb{R}$ and minor axis length $b \in \mathbb{R}$ (Having $a > b$).

### Ontaining the ellipse equation
We first need to get the generic equation of an ellipse. For simplicity, we will consider an ellipse centered at the origin of a reference system. The area does not change if the ellipse is placed elsewhere of if it is rotated. Assuming a centered allipse with no rotation simply makes our calculations easier. And we start from the definition of ellipse:

> The ellipse is the geometric locus of all points such that the sum of the distances between them and two specific points, called _foci_, is constant.
